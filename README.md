# Flappy-Bird-Android-Game
Flappy Bird is a game that is based on a bird moving between some pipes in order to cross a path without touching the pipes. The game starts when the user taps the screen. Immediately the bird starts to move and at the same time due to gravity it starts to fall down. User again taps the screen to give a boost to the bird to move up and keeps on tapping the screen at a desired rate. Pipes come in the path in a random order and the bird gets from between those pipes. When the bird crosses the pipe, a score count is increased immediately and continues to increase till the bird is moving. As soon as the bird touches some pipe or the ground the game stops showing the score which the user attained. The game can be started again by tapping the screen again.
